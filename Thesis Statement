// The Solution of Problem Which will be provide throughout the project:


Thesis Statement:
Accounding recent study we found that above 70% of young professionals (22-35) experience significant stress and spend an average of 15 hours planning personal events.
To address this challenge, we propose an HCI-powered event planning platform that automates tasks, personalizes recommendations, and integrates with relevant services.
Unlike existing solutions, our platform leverages HCI & Recommended System to dynamically manage budgets, optimize vendor selection, and streamline guest communication, 
aiming to reduce planning time by 50% and significantly decrease stress levels.This enhanced efficiency will empower young professionals to dedicate more time to their work, personal lives, and creating truly memorable events.
